# lennybot

## Origin
One upon time a colleague (Lenny) left my team.
One of the tasks he really liked doing, was the updating of the dependencies in our applications.
Since everyone else in the team didnt like this job, we needed some automation for this.
The lennybot was born to replace our colleague.
Since then the lennybot evolved and finally got replaced by the dependabot.
Some years later i needed a solution to upgrade components managed with kustomize.
This lead to the creation of a new lennybot which is able to automatically search for updates
and upgrades the resources with their latest versions.
